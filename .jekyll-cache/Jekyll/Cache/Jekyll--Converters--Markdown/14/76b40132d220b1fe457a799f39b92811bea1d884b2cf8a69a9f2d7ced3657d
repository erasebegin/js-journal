I"ñ<p>The challenge: take a string and a number and repeat the string that number of times. An empty string must be returned if the number is less than 0. I really canâ€™t see this being much of a problem. First Iâ€™ll want to check it the number is 0 or more, so Iâ€™ll open with an if statement. If that condition is met then perhaps I can use a for loop along with the concatenate method to create the new string. The else statement will create an empty string. Letâ€™s see how that pans out.</p>
