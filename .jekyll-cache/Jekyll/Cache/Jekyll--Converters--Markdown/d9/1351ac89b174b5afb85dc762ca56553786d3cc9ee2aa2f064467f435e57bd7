<p>I have to check each element in an array for a falsy value. According to a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35642809/understanding-javascript-truthy-and-falsy">stackoverflow</a> post â€œall values are truthy unless they are defined as falsy.â€</p>

<p>Values defined as falsy are Nan, undefined, 0, null, an empty string (â€˜ â€˜), and of course, false. I think I can just use a for loop and a non-strict equivalence operator (==) to check if the value returns false. Iâ€™m sure there will be more to it, but on this occassion, and in future, I will try to avoid to avoid using for loops. A friend of mine says that they are problematic and outdated so I should be using array methods like map(), filter() and reduce().</p>

<p>In this case I think filter will be the best choice since I am wanting to â€˜filterâ€™ out values of a certain kind.</p>

<p>So, when I log this:</p>

<p>arr.filter(val =&gt; val == false)</p>

<p>it seems to work, so now I need to think of a way of removing these values from the array. Maybe Iâ€™m thinking backwards actually. Itâ€™s probably much easier to use the filter to return all truthy values.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s kind of working, but there are several kinks. I wonder if itâ€™s a quirk of javascript that my function is registering undefined and false as false, but none of the other falsy values. I think itâ€™s a problem with my function in the filter. I will try and write an if statement that just asks if(val) do something, else do nothing. Can I use a conditional with filterâ€¦.? Letâ€™s find out.</p>

<p>I donâ€™t think so. I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s a thing that can be done. From where I stand at the base of the mountain I canâ€™t see a way to do it. So letâ€™s keep climbing and see what else we find.</p>

<p>Um, actually yes. Yes itâ€™s a thing. Itâ€™s totally a thing and itâ€™s totally working. My whole function looks super slim and itâ€™s working! This is it:</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">bouncer</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">arr</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
 <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">arr</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">filter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">val</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="nx">val</span> <span class="p">?</span> <span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="kc">false</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Thatâ€™s the whole thing! Definitely the sexiest function I have written so far.</p>
