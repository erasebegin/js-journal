Somewhere around the middle of 2018 I became obsessed with coding. Once I became familiar with the basics, I got quite addicted to the process of solving problems in a program. I have never been more engrossed in programming than when I was first presented with these simple challenges on [FreeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org). Although my knowledge was very limited and I had very few tools that I was capable of using to overcome obstacles, this gave structure to my thought processes and allowed me to solve problems in a more child-like way. I am much more capable than when I wrote my first entry into JS Journal, but I am less than half way up the great mountain that is modern javascript. It is truly a gargantuan beast and I continue to wrestle with it on a regular basis. I hope that you can find some use or enjoyment from my naive perspective as it is recorded here.
